**作成者**: Kiro AI IDE  
**プロジェクト**: ブレイクアウト手法実運用システム統合プロジェクト

## Introduction

本プロジェクトは、Gemini満点評価(5.0/5.0)を獲得したPython WFAシステムを基盤として、実際の取引実行が可能な統合システムを構築することを目的とする。既存の並列処理最適化(19倍高速化・0.58秒実行)とスリッパージ統合機能を維持しながら、MT4との連携による実取引フローを実現する。

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to automatically execute breakout trades based on WFA-optimized parameters, so that I can benefit from systematic trading without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WFA optimization completes THEN the system SHALL automatically update MT4 EA parameters within 5 seconds
2. WHEN a breakout signal is generated THEN the system SHALL execute the trade within 100ms of signal detection
3. WHEN market conditions change THEN the system SHALL adapt position sizing based on current volatility within 50ms
4. IF communication between Python and MT4 fails THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection up to 3 times
5. WHEN a trade is executed THEN the system SHALL log all execution details including slippage and actual fill price

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a trader, I want real-time monitoring of system health and trading performance, so that I can ensure the system operates safely and profitably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL perform comprehensive health checks on all components within 30 seconds
2. WHEN system availability drops below 99% THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts and initiate recovery procedures
3. WHEN drawdown exceeds predefined limits THEN the system SHALL automatically halt trading and require manual intervention
4. IF any component fails THEN the system SHALL isolate the failure and continue operating with remaining components
5. WHEN trading session ends THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive performance reports within 60 seconds

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a trader, I want seamless integration between Python WFA optimization and MT4 execution, so that I can leverage the best of both platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Python generates trading signals THEN MT4 SHALL receive and process them within 50ms
2. WHEN MT4 executes a trade THEN Python SHALL receive confirmation and update position tracking within 100ms
3. IF WSL2-Windows communication fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to file-based communication automatically
4. WHEN parameter updates are required THEN the system SHALL synchronize all components without service interruption
5. WHEN system restarts THEN all components SHALL restore their previous state within 2 minutes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a trader, I want robust risk management and position control, so that I can protect my capital from unexpected market events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN position size calculation is required THEN the system SHALL consider current account balance, volatility, and risk parameters
2. WHEN maximum daily loss limit is reached THEN the system SHALL immediately close all positions and halt trading
3. IF market volatility exceeds normal ranges THEN the system SHALL reduce position sizes by 50%
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL maintain protective stops on all open positions
5. WHEN emergency shutdown is triggered THEN all positions SHALL be closed within 30 seconds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive data persistence and recovery capabilities, so that I can maintain system continuity across restarts and failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WFA optimization results are generated THEN they SHALL be persisted to SQLite database within 5 seconds
2. WHEN system state changes THEN snapshots SHALL be saved automatically every hour
3. IF system crashes THEN it SHALL recover to the last known good state within 3 minutes of restart
4. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL restore from the most recent valid backup automatically
5. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide access to at least 6 months of trading history

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to maintain compatibility with existing automation infrastructure, so that I can preserve my current operational setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new system is deployed THEN existing cron automation SHALL continue to function without modification
2. WHEN system operates THEN it SHALL maintain the current 19-worker parallel processing performance
3. IF existing Gemini 5.0/5.0 rated components are used THEN their functionality SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN system runs THEN it SHALL respect the 09:00-22:00 operational window with automatic shutdown
5. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL support hot-swapping of individual components
